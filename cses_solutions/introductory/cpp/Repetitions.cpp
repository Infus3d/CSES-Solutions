 * 
 * We keep a counter 'cnt' that keeps track of current size of the repetition.
 * In the given string, on every index i for 0 < i < n we increase cnt by
 * 1 if string[i] == string[i-1] or we set it to 1 if they are not equal.
 * To get the maximum length of such repetitions we just take maximum
 * of cnt with current answer on every iteration i.
 * 
 * The code below uses cin/cout of C++ instead of scanf/printf of C because
 * we can not scan a 'string' object with C methods.
 * 
 * Runtime O(n)
